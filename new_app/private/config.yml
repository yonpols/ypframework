#Custom paths. YPFramework defines the following paths when sarting, which you can
#use to build your own custom paths:
#  app -> application base path.
#  ypf -> ypframework path
#  www -> public www files path. Generally APP_PATH/www
#  log -> log files path         Generally APP_PATH/support/log
#  tmp -> temporary files path.  Generally APP_PATH/support/tmp
#         below this path you can find compiled templates and caches
paths:
  db: '{%paths.app}/support/db'

#YPFramework can run different configurations for one application. This is
#called an environment. You can use any name that you want except for one rule.
#YPFramework will assume that any environment whose name is not "production" is
#a development environment applying some default settings. On the other hand, it
#will consider the environment "production" as the one meant to be on production systems.
#environments is mandatory

#You can force YPFramework to start working in a specified environment
#mode: 'production'

    #If you need your application to connect to databases you must set at least one connection
